Health digital twins, dynamic, computational representations of health that evolve over time and span individuals, communities, and populations that integrate multimodal data and muti-scale models, are an emerging paradigm with the potential to transform clinical development and how we diagnosis, monitor, and personalize care in the real-world setting. This workshop invites submissions exploring the design, evaluation, deployment, and governance of health digital twins with a particular emphasis on data interoperability, model validity, explainability, real-world clinical and population integration, and governance frameworks that enable trustworthy, equitable, responsible use, and clinical development impact in human‑centered health care.

We welcome work spanning methods, applied systems, clinical pilots, datasets, standards, ethics, and socio‑technical perspectives.

#### Scope and topics of interest
- Data architectures, standards, and interoperability (EHR, FHIR, OMOP, open EHR, multimodal fusion)
- Multi‑scale and hybrid modeling (mechanistic + data‑driven integration)
- Real‑time sensing, streaming updates, and digital biomarkers from wearables
- Clinical decision support and closed‑loop systems informed by patient twins
- Validation, benchmarking, and clinical evaluation protocols for twins
- Explainability, visualization, and clinician/patient interaction design for trust
- Privacy‑preserving methods, federated learning and data governance in twins
- Ethical, legal, and regulatory considerations for deployment and liability
- Datasets, synthetic data, and reproducibility practices for twin research
- Translational case studies: Oncology, Immunology, Cardiovascular disease, Neuroscience
