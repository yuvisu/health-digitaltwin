### Overview

Health digital twins, although no consensus on precise definitions, are dynamic, computational representations of health and disease that span multiple levels of biological and social organization, from cells and organs to individuals, families, communities and populations. Enabled by advances in multimodal data integration (of clinical, physiological, behavioral, imaging, and molecular data), AI foundation models, mechanistic and causal modeling, and interoperable digital infrastructures, health digital twins hold the potential to transform prediction, prevention, monitoring, and tailored clinical decision-making across the continuum of care and human health. 

This workshop convenes researchers, clinicians, data and standards experts, ethicists, and regulators, and industry leaders to explore the emerging science and practice and the technical, clinical, and socio‑technical challenges of building trustworthy, multi-scale health digital twins. Through invited talks, demonstrations, and focused interactive working group discussions, participants will examine state-of-the-art approaches to data harmonization, multi-scale and hybrid modeling, validation and evaluation, and governance frameworks that embed transparency, equity, and human oversight. The goal is to align technical innovation, establish best practices, and develop a research agenda with clinical development and patient needs, accelerating responsible translation from research to real-world impact.

### CALL FOR PAPERS: 

Health digital twins, dynamic, computational representations of health that evolve over time and span individuals, communities, and populations that integrate multimodal data and muti-scale models, are an emerging paradigm with the potential to transform clinical development and how we diagnosis, monitor, and personalize care in the real-world setting. This workshop invites submissions exploring the design, evaluation, deployment, and governance of health digital twins with a particular emphasis on data interoperability, model validity, explainability, real-world clinical and population integration, and governance frameworks that enable trustworthy, equitable, responsible use, and clinical development impact in human‑centered health care.

We welcome work spanning methods, applied systems, clinical pilots, datasets, standards, ethics, and socio‑technical perspectives.
