We are inviting contributions to the Digital Patient Twins, including regular papers, short papers, and abstract for posters.

- Regular papers (8-10 pages, including references) will describe mature ideas, where a substantial amount of implementation, experimentation, or data collection and analysis has been completed.
- Short papers (4-6 pages, including references) will describe innovative ideas, where preliminary implementation and validation work have been conducted.
- Abstracts (1 page, including references) will describe your vision, work in progress and preliminary results.

Your submissions must adhere to the [IEEE Proceedings Format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates). All papers will be submitted and handled through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hdt2026). Submissions must contain the names and affiliations of authors listed on the paper. The review process will be single-blinded.
